# DomNomNom

This project is a code playground where you can experiment with JavaScript and the DOM to display food items on an HTML page.

You’ll get to create and display food cards, giving you a hands-on way to see how JavaScript can bring Objects/HTML to life.

It’s a great way to practice your coding skills and have some fun with food displays!
